# CIKM2019
This is an anonymous temporary repository for Context-Aware Semantic Annotation of Mobility Records, a paper submitted to CIKM 2019. This repository only contains a small part of our data and codes. We will release all data and codes upon the acceptance of our paper.

Since the training set is not released yet, we provide parameters trained by Gibbs sampling. The test set of Guangzhou dataset is uploaded and you can view the result by running Evaluate.py with Python3.
